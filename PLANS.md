Improving the quality of the currency conversion application can involve several aspects, such as enhancing the user experience, improving performance, adding more features, and ensuring robustness. Here are some future improvements and enhancements you could consider:

1. User Experience Enhancements
   Improved Input Validation: Provide more detailed error messages and suggestions for correcting input errors.
   Auto-Completion and Suggestions: Implement auto-completion for currency names, codes, and symbols to help users input data more accurately.
   Interactive User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like gtk-rs for a more user-friendly experience.
2. Performance Improvements
   Concurrency: Implement concurrency for handling multiple conversions simultaneously, especially if you plan to extend the app to handle bulk conversions or run as a service.
   Efficient Data Structures: Use more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to speed up frequently used operations.
3. Feature Additions
   Historical Exchange Rates: Add support for historical exchange rates, allowing users to see how conversion rates have changed over time.
   Live Exchange Rates: Integrate with a live exchange rate API to provide up-to-date conversion rates.
   Multi-Currency Conversion: Allow users to convert an amount into multiple currencies at once.
   Batch Processing: Enable batch processing of multiple conversions from a file or a list.
4. Robustness and Error Handling
   Comprehensive Error Handling: Improve error handling to cover more edge cases and provide meaningful feedback to users.
   Testing: Write comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability of the application.
   Logging: Implement logging to record conversion requests, errors, and other significant events for troubleshooting and analysis.
5. Documentation and Help
   User Documentation: Create detailed documentation and help guides to assist users in understanding how to use the application.
   Code Documentation: Add comments and documentation to the code to make it easier for other developers to understand and contribute.
6. Extensibility
   Plugin System: Develop a plugin system that allows users to add new features or support for additional currencies without modifying the core application.
   API: Expose the conversion functionality through a RESTful API, allowing other applications to integrate with your currency converter.
7. Security
   Input Sanitization: Ensure that all user inputs are properly sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities.
   Secure API Integration: If integrating with external APIs, ensure that all communications are secure and authenticated.
   Example: Implementing Live Exchange Rates
   To give a concrete example of how to implement live exchange rates, you can integrate an external API like exchangerate-api.com or openexchangerates.org.

Here's a rough sketch of how you might integrate live exchange rates using reqwest and serde for making HTTP requests and parsing JSON responses:
